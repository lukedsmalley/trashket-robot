The course instructor was [Doctor Michael Weeks](https://hallertau.cs.gsu.edu/~mweeks/index.html), who maintains [this webpage](https://hallertau.cs.gsu.edu/~mweeks/csc4110/) for the course in current and past terms (Those links are active as this document is written, but is apparently running on some box inside the GSU CS department, so may not be available forever).
